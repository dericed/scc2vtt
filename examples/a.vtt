00:00:00.00 --> 00:00:02.00 
GREAT WHITE PEOPLE WHO MARCHED
 

00:00:02.00 --> 00:00:04.00 
GREAT WHITE PEOPLE W W WHO MARCHED  
WITH THOSE GREAT BLACK LEADERS.
 

00:00:04.00 --> 00:00:05.00 
>> WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO RAISE 

00:00:05.00 --> 00:00:07.00 
THE ISSUE OF GAY RIGHTS, 

00:00:07.00 --> 00:00:08.00 
ESPECIALLY AMONG ATHLETES IN THE 

00:00:08.00 --> 00:00:12.00 
LOCKER ROOM OR WHATEVER WITH 

00:00:12.00 --> 00:00:13.00 
THIS PRESIDENT? 

00:00:13.00 --> 00:00:15.00 
>> WELL, I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT 

00:00:15.00 --> 00:00:19.00 
AS A BLACK MAN TO ALWAYS BE 

00:00:19.00 --> 00:00:19.00 
INCLUSIVE. 

00:00:19.00 --> 00:00:21.00 
I'M ALWAYS AGAINST ANY FORM OF 

00:00:21.00 --> 00:00:23.00 
DISCRIMINATION. 

00:00:23.00 --> 00:00:25.00 
I LEARNED THAT IN BILL RUSSELL. 

00:00:25.00 --> 00:00:26.00 
AS A BLACK PLAYER, WE ALWAYS 

00:00:26.00 --> 00:00:28.00 
WANT TO BE INCLUSIVE. 

00:00:28.00 --> 00:00:30.00 
AND WE'VE ALL PLAYED WITH GAY 

00:00:30.00 --> 00:00:30.00 
PLAYERS. 

00:00:30.00 --> 00:00:33.00 
LISTEN, WE SHOULD NOT 

00:00:33.00 --> 00:00:33.00 
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST ANYBODY. 

00:00:33.00 --> 00:00:36.00 
AND I THINK IT'S AN INSULT TO 

00:00:36.00 --> 00:00:37.00 
GAY PEOPLE TO THINK THAT THEY'RE 

00:00:37.00 --> 00:00:39.00 
GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THEIR 

00:00:39.00 --> 00:00:41.00 
TEAMMATES IN A SEXUAL WAY. 

00:00:41.00 --> 00:00:43.00 
THAT'S AN INSULT TO ALL GAY MEN. 

00:00:43.00 --> 00:00:45.00 
AND WE WELCOME THEM TO THE 

00:00:45.00 --> 00:00:46.00 
LOCKER ROOM. 

00:00:46.00 --> 00:00:49.00 
AND I WISH MR. SAM THE BEST. 

00:00:49.00 --> 00:00:50.00 
AND I'M GLAD ATTORNEY GENERAL 

00:00:50.00 --> 00:00:55.00 
HOLDER ANNOUNCED  TO THAT OTHER 

00:00:55.00 --> 00:00:57.00 
SUBJECT YOU RAISED FOR A MOMENT. 

00:00:57.00 --> 00:00:59.00 
GAY RIGHTS. 

00:00:59.00 --> 00:01:00.00 
AND GAY BASKETBALL PLAYERS. 

00:01:00.00 --> 00:01:02.00 
RIGHT NOW, AS FAR AS I KNOW -- 

00:01:02.00 --> 00:01:03.00 
YOU TELL ME -- THERE ARE NO 

00:01:03.00 --> 00:01:05.00 
OPENLY GAY PLAYERS IN THE NBA. 

00:01:05.00 --> 00:01:07.00 
I ASSUME THERE ARE SEVERAL GAYS 

00:01:07.00 --> 00:01:08.00 
WHO ARE PLAYING IN THE NBA, BUT 

00:01:08.00 --> 00:01:09.00 
THEY'RE NOT OPEN ABOUT IT. 

00:01:09.00 --> 00:01:13.00 
WHEN THEY START COMING OUT AND 

00:01:13.00 --> 00:01:17.00 
PLAYING ON ACTIVE ROSTERS, HOW 

00:01:17.00 --> 00:01:20.00 
WILL THEY BE RECEIVED BY THEIR 

00:01:20.00 --> 00:01:20.00 
TEAMMATES, CHARLES? 

00:01:20.00 --> 00:01:21.00 
>> WELL, I THINK THEY'RE GOING 

00:01:21.00 --> 00:01:24.00 
TO BE SAFE WITH THEIR TEAMMATES. 

00:01:24.00 --> 00:01:26.00 
I THINK THE PUBLIC IN LARGE IS 

00:01:26.00 --> 00:01:28.00 
MORE HOMOPHOBIC THAN GUYS IN THE 

00:01:28.00 --> 00:01:29.00 
LOCKER ROOM. 

00:01:29.00 --> 00:01:31.00 
I THINK WE AS PLAYERS GET A BAD 

00:01:31.00 --> 00:01:31.00 
RAP. 

00:01:31.00 --> 00:01:34.00 
IF YOU GO BACK AND LOOK AT THAT 

00:01:34.00 --> 00:01:36.00 
MICHAEL SAM INTERVIEW, HE TOLD 

00:01:36.00 --> 00:01:37.00 
HIS TEAM OVER THE SUMMER. 

00:01:37.00 --> 00:01:39.00 
HE NEVER HAD AN ISSUE. 

00:01:39.00 --> 00:01:41.00 
NONE OF THOSE PLAYERS OUTTED HIM 

00:01:41.00 --> 00:01:44.00 
ON INSTAGRAM OR TWITTER OR OTHER 

00:01:44.00 --> 00:01:45.00 
ALL THAT SOCIAL CRAP. 

00:01:45.00 --> 00:01:48.00 
AND THAT WAS ANOTHER COLLEGE 

00:01:48.00 --> 00:01:49.00 
PLAYER WHO CAME OUT ON HIS TEAM. 

00:01:49.00 --> 00:01:52.00 
AND HE SAID HE WAS TREATED 

00:01:52.00 --> 00:01:52.00 
GREAT. 

00:01:52.00 --> 00:01:53.00 
I THINK PLAYERS ARE GOING TO 

00:01:53.00 --> 00:01:54.00 
RESPECT EACH OTHER. 

00:01:54.00 --> 00:01:56.00 
AND WE SHOULD RESPECT EACH 

00:01:56.00 --> 00:00:00.000 
OTHER.
